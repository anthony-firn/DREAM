# Communication Plan for DREAM Project

## Introduction

Effective communication is at the heart of the DREAM Project. As we aim to democratize Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), we strive to build an inclusive, transparent, and engaged community. This communication plan outlines the channels and strategies we aim to employ to share our progress, listen to our contributors, and grow together in our journey. 

**Please note that while we are in the process of setting up these communication channels, your enthusiasm and contributions are welcome. Feel free to reach out via email at [anthonyfirn@illi.ac](mailto:anthonyfirn@illi.ac) to discuss how you can help in establishing these systems.**

## Communication Channels

### Newsletter

We plan to have a monthly newsletter as one of the primary ways we keep the community informed. It will include project updates, upcoming events, and highlights from the community. 

### Social Media

We aim to use various social media platforms to share updates and engage with our community in real-time.

### Blog

The DREAM blog, once set up, will feature in-depth articles, tutorials, and thought leadership pieces on AGI. Our blog posts will aim to educate, inspire, and spur conversations around AGI's potentials and challenges.

### Community Forums

We're in the process of setting up community forums - platforms where community members can ask questions, share ideas, and help each other. 

## Community Engagement Activities

### Webinars and Q&A Sessions

We intend to hold regular webinars featuring our team members and guest experts in the field of AGI. 

### Hackathons and Contribution Events

In the future, we'll organize hackathons and other contribution events throughout the year.

## Regular Updates and Transparency Measures

Transparency is one of our core values. We will strive to provide clear, timely updates about our progress and future plans once our communication channels are established.

## Feedback Mechanisms

We're eager to hear your feedback. We plan to use various feedback mechanisms, including surveys, forum threads, and social media polls, to understand our community's needs and concerns.
