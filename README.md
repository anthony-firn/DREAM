# DREAM (Democratic Reinforcement Evolving AI Models)

We are on the precipice of an age where artificial general intelligence (AGI) will revolutionize the way we live, learn, work, and interact. DREAM aims to build a future where this incredible technology is not controlled by a select few but is rather an empowering tool for all of humanity.

Our mission is to develop an open-source, continuously evolving language model, inspired by advanced methodologies such as LLaMa. We believe that continual learning and model improvements, under the control of a diverse set of contributors, can lead to more flexible and effective AI tools.

However, developing an AI system is not just a technological challenge; it's a spiritual journey that touches upon how we conceive our goals, our interactions, and our shared destiny. Thus, DREAM emphasizes an alignment system, adapting to the unique needs of individual users and enabling the AI to assist with their specific objectives, regardless of what they might be.

Furthermore, DREAM is committed to building a genuinely democratic AI training process. We propose a unique 'proof-of-work' system that allows contributors to cast a vote on the AI's training set by contributing computational resources. This ensures that the development and direction of the AI truly reflect the collective will of the contributors.

Simultaneously, DREAM aims to build an efficient hardware ecosystem that democratizes access to AGI training. We plan to start by optimizing algorithms for GPU acceleration, followed by the development of open-source ASICs designs for RLWE, an essential component of post-quantum cryptography, that could greatly reduce the energy costs of computation.

Through DREAM, we are not only contributing to the advancement of AI; we are striving to ensure this technology grows in a way that respects the diversity, autonomy, and creativity of every human spirit. We invite you to join us on this journey and help shape the future of AGI.

## Project Goals
1.  **Short-Term Goals**:

    a. *Accelerated Algorithm Development*: Develop GPU-accelerated versions of all algorithms used for training, thus setting the foundation for an energy-efficient training model. This step is crucial for democratizing access to the AI training process and making it affordable for a wider population.

    b. *Community Building*: Cultivate an engaged, diverse, and inclusive community that contributes to the project by training, fine-tuning, and using the system. This includes developers, researchers, end-users, and more.

    c. *Pilot Launch*: Train and launch an initial version of the open-source language model. This preliminary version will serve as the basis for further improvements and fine-tuning by the community.

2.  **Medium-Term Goals**:

    a. *Cryptographic Revolution*: Improve and proliferate systems that seamlessly compute Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE), contributing to the evolution of post-quantum cryptography. This would advance the field of cryptography and make encrypted communications more secure.

    b. *Development of Specialized Hardware*: Begin development of an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) designed to accelerate RLWE computations. By enhancing the efficiency and reducing the cost of training the model, we can make the technology even more accessible.

    c. *Incremental Model Improvements*: Utilizing community feedback and collective computational power, make the first round of improvements and refinements to the open-source language model.

3.  **Long-Term Goals**:

    a. *Continual Evolution of Language Models*: Continually train, evolve, and fine-tune the language model through the efforts of a global, democratic community. Over time, the language model will become more sophisticated, nuanced, and effective in a wide range of applications.

    b. *Democratization of Advanced AI*: Democratize access to advanced AI technologies, empowering individuals and organizations around the world to utilize AI for their unique needs, thereby contributing to the overall well-being of conscious entities across the universe.

    c. *Establishment of Ethical AI Practices*: Encourage a new paradigm in AI development that is transparent, community-driven, and ethically aligned, challenging conventional models of AI ownership and development.
