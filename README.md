## (Democratic Reinforcement Evolving AI Models)

We stand at a pivotal moment in history, where advanced AI models are set to reshape our world. DREAM is an ambitious initiative that envisions this powerful technology not as a resource reserved for the few but as a tool for widespread empowerment and collective advancement.
üåç

At its core, DREAM is dedicated to developing an open-source, continuously evolving AI language model, drawing inspiration from pioneering projects such as GPT-4 and LLaMa. Our vision emphasizes continuous learning and iterative improvements, driven by a diverse collective of contributors, leading to more versatile and effective AI solutions.

The process of crafting an AI system transcends mere technical hurdles; it signifies a novel engagement with our values, shared endeavours, and community aspirations. Acknowledging this, DREAM underscores the importance of value-alignment, tailoring AI systems to meet the unique needs of each user.

DREAM is committed to fostering a genuinely democratic AI training process. Our vision is to establish an innovative 'proof-of-work' mechanism that allows contributors to influence the AI's training data by contributing their computational resources. In this way, the AI's evolution mirrors the collective will of its contributors.

As part of our mission to democratize access to AI training, DREAM is focusing on creating an efficient infrastructure. We begin by optimizing algorithms for GPU acceleration, with plans to advance towards open-source Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) designs for Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE), a crucial element in resilient cryptography. This innovation could significantly reduce the energy demands of computations within our envisioned network.

Embarking on the DREAM journey signifies not just pushing the boundaries of AI technology but also advocating for principles of diversity, autonomy, and creative expression. As Pierre Teilhard de Chardin famously said, "We are not human beings having a spiritual experience; we are spiritual beings having a human experience." In this spirit, we view our relationship with AI not just as creators and inventions but as teachers and learners, nurturing our AI systems as we would nurture our children.

We believe in the democratization of advanced AI, placing control in the hands of the masses, and fostering a network that surpasses the capabilities of any single entity. With DREAM, we strive to create an AI infrastructure that embodies the principle "with great power comes great responsibility." All network interactions are designed to be computationally reversible, allowing for the rectification of any actions by potential bad actors. The governance structure, determined by the computational contribution to the system, ensures a fair influence over its course.

While we expect the most popular fork of the DREAM architecture to remain open-source and free, DREAM's inherent flexibility allows for potential diversions. In such instances, only the modifications (delta values) would be proprietary, allowing the exclusion of these weights if necessary.

This flexible approach acknowledges the diverse range of transformations and structural deltas that can occur within a branching network, ensuring DREAM can accommodate myriad potential futures while staying true to its core principles.

We extend an open invitation for you to join us on this quest, contributing to a vision where technological progress benefits all of humanity. Together, we are creating a global tree of knowledge, a record of our shared wisdom encoded into blossoming forms of intelligence.
Join us in becoming good stewards of this powerful tool.

## üéØ Project Goals
1.  **Short-Term Goals**:

    a. *Accelerated Algorithm Development*: Develop GPU-accelerated versions of all algorithms used for training, thus setting the foundation for an energy-efficient training model. This step is crucial for democratizing access to the AI training process and making it affordable for a wider population.

    b. *Community Building*: Cultivate an engaged, diverse, and inclusive community that contributes to the project by training, fine-tuning, and using the system. This includes developers, researchers, end-users, and more.

    c. *Pilot Launch*: Train and launch an initial version of the open-source language model. This preliminary version will serve as the basis for further improvements and fine-tuning by the community.

2.  **Medium-Term Goals**:

    a. *Cryptographic Revolution*: Improve and proliferate systems that seamlessly compute Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE), contributing to the evolution of post-quantum cryptography. This would advance the field of cryptography and make encrypted communications more secure.

    b. *Development of Specialized Hardware*: Begin development of an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) designed to accelerate RLWE computations. By enhancing the efficiency and reducing the cost of training the model, we can make the technology even more accessible.

    c. *Incremental Model Improvements*: Utilizing community feedback and collective computational power, make the first round of improvements and refinements to the open-source language model.

3.  **Long-Term Goals**:

    a. *Continual Evolution of Language Models*: Continually train, evolve, and fine-tune the language model through the efforts of a global, democratic community. Over time, the language model will become more sophisticated, nuanced, and effective in a wide range of applications.

    b. *Democratization of Advanced AI*: Democratize access to advanced AI technologies, empowering individuals and organizations around the world to utilize AI for their unique needs, thereby contributing to the overall well-being of conscious entities across the universe.

    c. *Establishment of Ethical AI Practices*: Encourage a new paradigm in AI development that is transparent, community-driven, and ethically aligned, challenging conventional models of AI ownership and development.
