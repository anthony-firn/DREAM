# DREAM (Democratic Reinforcement Evolving AI Models)

We are on the precipice of an age where artificial general intelligence (AGI) will revolutionize the way we live, learn, work, and interact. DREAM aims to build a future where this incredible technology is not controlled by a select few but is rather an empowering tool for all of humanity.

Our mission is to develop an open-source, continuously evolving language model, inspired by advanced methodologies such as LLaMa. We believe that continual learning and model improvements, under the control of a diverse set of contributors, can lead to more flexible and effective AI tools.

However, developing an AI system is not just a technological challenge; it's a spiritual journey that touches upon how we conceive our goals, our interactions, and our shared destiny. Thus, DREAM emphasizes an alignment system, adapting to the unique needs of individual users and enabling the AI to assist with their specific objectives, regardless of what they might be.

Furthermore, DREAM is committed to building a genuinely democratic AI training process. We propose a unique 'proof-of-work' system that allows contributors to cast a vote on the AI's training set by contributing computational resources. This ensures that the development and direction of the AI truly reflect the collective will of the contributors.

Simultaneously, DREAM aims to build an efficient hardware ecosystem that democratizes access to AGI training. We plan to start by optimizing algorithms for GPU acceleration, followed by the development of open-source ASICs designs for RLWE, an essential component of post-quantum cryptography, that could greatly reduce the energy costs of computation.

Through DREAM, we are not only contributing to the advancement of AI; we are striving to ensure this technology grows in a way that respects the diversity, autonomy, and creativity of every human spirit. We invite you to join us on this journey and help shape the future of AGI.

## Project Goals
1.  **Short-Term Goals**:

    a. *Accelerated Algorithm Development*: Develop GPU-accelerated versions of all algorithms used for training, thus setting the foundation for an energy-efficient training model. This step is crucial for democratizing access to the AI training process and making it affordable for a wider population.

    b. *Community Building*: Cultivate an engaged, diverse, and inclusive community that contributes to the project by training, fine-tuning, and using the system. This includes developers, researchers, end-users, and more.

    c. *Pilot Launch*: Train and launch an initial version of the open-source language model. This preliminary version will serve as the basis for further improvements and fine-tuning by the community.

2.  **Medium-Term Goals**:

    a. *Cryptographic Revolution*: Improve and proliferate systems that seamlessly compute Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE), contributing to the evolution of post-quantum cryptography. This would advance the field of cryptography and make encrypted communications more secure.

    b. *Development of Specialized Hardware*: Begin development of an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) designed to accelerate RLWE computations. By enhancing the efficiency and reducing the cost of training the model, we can make the technology even more accessible.

    c. *Incremental Model Improvements*: Utilizing community feedback and collective computational power, make the first round of improvements and refinements to the open-source language model.

3.  **Long-Term Goals**:

    a. *Continual Evolution of Language Models*: Continually train, evolve, and fine-tune the language model through the efforts of a global, democratic community. Over time, the language model will become more sophisticated, nuanced, and effective in a wide range of applications.

    b. *Democratization of Advanced AI*: Democratize access to advanced AI technologies, empowering individuals and organizations around the world to utilize AI for their unique needs, thereby contributing to the overall well-being of conscious entities across the universe.

    c. *Establishment of Ethical AI Practices*: Encourage a new paradigm in AI development that is transparent, community-driven, and ethically aligned, challenging conventional models of AI ownership and development.

## Project Beneficiaries
1.  **Individual Users**: The direct beneficiaries would be individuals from all walks of life who have access to the platform. This could include students, researchers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in artificial intelligence, language models, or cryptography. They can use DREAM for various tasks, like question answering, writing, programming help, learning new topics, or anything that can be facilitated by a language model. The democratic fine-tuning aspect allows them to customize the AI according to their needs.

2.  **Educational Institutions**: Schools, colleges, and universities could benefit from an advanced, continually evolving language model. It could be used as a tool for teaching, for assisting in research, and for academic exploration in the field of AI.

3.  **Researchers and Developers**: AI researchers and developers can benefit from the open-source nature of DREAM. It allows them to study, contribute to, and build upon the advanced methodologies employed by DREAM.

4.  **Tech Companies**: Companies can use DREAM to improve their services, by integrating it into their applications, websites, and services. This could span industries from customer service (automated chatbots) to content creation (automated writing assistants).

5.  **Cryptography and Security Sector**: Given the post-quantum cryptographic element of the project, professionals and companies in the field of cybersecurity could benefit from DREAM. They could use the technology to develop more secure systems and to explore post-quantum cryptographic techniques.

6.  **Society at large**: DREAM could help democratize access to advanced AI technology. By making DREAM accessible to all, and by allowing democratic fine-tuning, the project can contribute to digital inclusion and empower people regardless of their technical background or financial capability.

7.  **Future Generations**: In the long run, DREAM could set a precedent for the democratic and inclusive development of AGI, contributing to a future where the benefits of advanced AI are shared widely rather than being concentrated in the hands of a few.

## Project Budget and Fundraising Goals

Our project budget is designed to ensure the sustainability of DREAM, allowing for the continual evolution and refinement of models. It also ensures the fair compensation of contributors and the establishment of efficient computational infrastructures. Here is an overview of our projected budget:

1. **Community Sourced Hardware** - $10,000: Budgeted for managing and coordinating the distributed network of GPUs provided by the community for model training.

2. **Development Tools & Services** - $20,000 per year: Budgeted for the various development tools and services needed for software development and project management.

3. **Team Salaries** - $500,000 per year: Budgeted for the salaries of key team members, who are crucial to the project's development, management, and growth.

4. **Contributor Compensation** - $300,000 per year: Budgeted for compensating community members for significant contributions to the project.

5. **Legal, Accounting, & Administrative** - $20,000 per year: Budgeted for various administrative expenses, including legal and accounting services.

6. **Marketing & Community Engagement** - $50,000 per year: Budgeted for activities to grow our user base and keep the community engaged.

In total, we are seeking to raise around $900,000 for the first year, and around $890,000 for subsequent years. This budget will support DREAM's mission to democratize advanced AI, provide secure cryptographic systems, and foster a community-driven approach to AGI development.
