# Contributing to DREAM

First off, thank you for considering contributing to DREAM! It's people like you that make DREAM such a great tool.

We welcome any type of contribution, not only code. You can help with:

- **QA**: File bug reports, the more details you can give the better (e.g. screenshots, log files).
- **Marketing**: Writing blog posts, how-to guides, examples, or explaining the project in layman's terms.
- **User Support**: Answering questions on the GitHub issue tracker, chat channels, or other forums.
- **Code**: Take a look at the open issues. Even if you can't write code, commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It helps us triage them.
- **Money**: We welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [Open Collective](insert link to your open collective).

## Your First Contribution

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this _free_ series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

## Submitting code

Any code change should be submitted as a pull request. The description should explain what the code does and give steps to execute it. The pull request should also include tests.

## Code review process

The bigger the pull request, the longer it takes to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests in smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge. It is also always helpful to have some context for your pull request. What was the purpose? Why does it matter to you?

## Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our open collective. Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.

## Community
