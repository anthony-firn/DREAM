## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [DREAM Code of Conduct](link to the Code of Conduct document). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [email].

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- We work hard to make sure issues are handled in a timely manner but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause of an issue.
- If you've never contributed before, see the first timer's guide on our website for how to get started. 

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](link to the project's issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](link to create a new issue). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Ensure the enhancement was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](link to the project's issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue proposing the enhancement, [open a new one](link to create a new issue). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **detailed explanation of the proposed enhancement**.

### Submitting Pull Requests

- The smaller the proposed change, the more likely it will be to be accepted.
- For ambitious tasks, consider breaking them down into smaller PRs to make it easier to review.
- PRs must pass the continuous integration checks and have no conflicts with the main branch.

## Style Guide

- Ensure your code follows the [DREAM Style Guide](link to the style guide).
- Whenever you are making a contribution to code, ensure it is following the project's code style guidelines. 

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Issue Process

Issues are very valuable and help the project maintainers understand what people are struggling with and what features are most valuable. However, we believe in quality over quantity when it comes to issues. Please adhere to these guidelines when creating issues:

1. Check that the issue has not already been reported.
2. Check that the issue has not already been fixed in the latest code.
3. Be clear, concise and precise in your description of the problem.
4. Open an issue with a descriptive title and a summary in grammatically correct, complete sentences.

## Additional Notes

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

Thanks again for taking the time to contribute!
