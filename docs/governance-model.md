# Governance Model

## Introduction

Welcome to the Governance Model of the DREAM project. This document outlines the decision-making process within our project, the roles and responsibilities of contributors, and our dispute resolution process. We believe in democratizing Artificial General Intelligence, and that extends to our governance model as well. Our aim is to ensure transparency, inclusivity, and fair decision-making in all aspects of DREAM.

> Note: This governance model is currently under development and is subject to change as we continue to refine it.

## Decision-Making Process

Decisions in the DREAM project are made collectively, emphasizing consensus and inclusivity. We operate on a consensus-seeking approach, where every voice is heard, and every concern is addressed.

1. **Proposal**: Any member of the community can propose changes or improvements. These are discussed and refined in an open forum.
2. **Discussion**: Proposals are open for discussion for a period of time, during which community members can provide feedback and voice any concerns.
3. **Consensus Seeking**: Once the discussion period is over, we aim for consensus. If consensus is reached, the proposal is approved. If consensus cannot be reached, a vote may occur.
4. **Voting**: In the rare event consensus cannot be reached, the Core Contributors may hold a vote. Each Core Contributor gets one vote, and a majority is needed for a proposal to be approved.

## Role of Contributors

Contributors are the lifeblood of DREAM. We recognize and appreciate the hard work our contributors put in, and we've defined roles to provide structure and clarity:

- **Community Member**: Anyone who interacts with the project in any space, including but not limited to, using the project, reporting issues, or discussing improvements.
- **Contributor**: Community Members who contribute in tangible ways to the project, through code, documentation, design, etc.
- **Core Contributor**: Contributors who have consistently provided quality contributions and shown a commitment to the project. Core Contributors have additional responsibilities and decision-making rights within the project.

## Dispute Resolution

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we are committed to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. If disputes arise, here are the steps we follow:

1. **Identify the Problem**: The first step is understanding the problem and its impact.
2. **Open a Discussion**: An open and respectful discussion should be held, allowing all parties to voice their concerns or views.
3. **Seek Mediation**: If a resolution cannot be reached, a neutral third party should be sought to mediate.
4. **Escalation to Core Contributors**: If no resolution can be found after mediation, the dispute may be escalated to Core Contributors for a final decision.

## Changes to the Governance Model

We believe in continuous improvement and understand that as our project grows and evolves, so should our governance model. Any significant changes to this model will follow the decision-making process outlined above, ensuring that all voices are heard and consensus is reached.

Thank you for taking the time to understand our governance model. It is designed with the aim of ensuring that DREAM remains a project where everyone feels heard, respected, and able to contribute. As we grow, we invite you to grow with us, shaping not just the future of DREAM, but the future of AGI.
