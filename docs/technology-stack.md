# Technology Stack

This document outlines the open-source projects that DREAM leverages and how they contribute to the project's goals.

## [Tinygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad)

Tinygrad is an open-source deep learning library that is extremely small and simple. It is used in DREAM for implementing the deep learning models that form the core of the AI system.

## [Hypercore](https://github.com/holepunchto/hypercore)

Hypercore is a distributed append-only log built on the peer-to-peer network protocol Hypercore Protocol. It is used in DREAM for data preparation, allowing data to be sourced from a distributed network of contributors.

## [Microsoft SEAL](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL)

Microsoft SEAL is a homomorphic encryption library that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data. It is used in DREAM for training the AI models, ensuring privacy and anonymity.

## [Go-Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)

Go-Ethereum, also known as Geth, is one of the three original implementations of the Ethereum protocol. It is used in DREAM for storing the model definition and evaluation results on a blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.

## [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache)

Ganache is a personal blockchain for Ethereum development. It is used in DREAM for testing the blockchain functionality before deploying it to the main Ethereum network.

## [Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle)

Truffle is a development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for Ethereum. It is used in DREAM for developing and testing the smart contracts that govern the project's blockchain functionality.

## [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts)

OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development on Ethereum and other EVM and eWASM blockchains. It is used in DREAM for implementing secure and standard compliant smart contracts.

## [Git](https://github.com/git/git)

Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system. It is used in DREAM for managing changes to the model definition, allowing each contributor to propose changes that are voted on by the network.
