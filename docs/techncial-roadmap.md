# Technical Roadmap for DREAM

## Introduction
DREAM (Democratic, Reliable, Explainable, Adaptable and Minimalistic) is our commitment to democratizing advanced machine intelligence. Our aim is to create a globally accessible, scalable and reliable model that can be trusted and utilized effectively for a wide range of tasks. This Technical Roadmap outlines our planned milestones and the direction of the project.

The roadmap is divided into short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals. Each of these sections is structured to provide clarity on our aspirations and the strategic path we are taking towards the democratization of advanced machine intelligence. 

## Short-Term Goals (Next 6-12 Months)

### Robust Infrastructure

- Setting up scalable cloud computing resources.
- Implementing secure data storage and management systems.
- Establishing rigorous security protocols.

### Initial Model Development

- Development of machine learning algorithms.
- Initial training and testing of our model.
- Establishing a framework for continual learning and adaptation.
- Exploration of LONGNET Integration: Research the feasibility and potential benefits of integrating the LONGNET model, which can handle extremely long sequences, into DREAM's architecture.

### Open Source Contribution Structure

- Establishing coding and documentation standards.
- Creating a system for submitting and reviewing contributions.

## Medium-Term Goals (1-3 Years)

### Advanced Model Development

- Improve the model's understanding, learning, and reasoning capabilities.
- Develop our model's capability for self-supervised learning.
- Advance our model's explainability and reliability.
- Implementation of LONGNET: If feasible, begin the process of integrating LONGNET into DREAM's architecture, and evaluate its performance on large datasets and complex tasks.

### User Interface and Experience

- Developing a web-based interface for users.
- Implementing a feedback mechanism to improve model performance and user experience.
- Developing APIs for developers to integrate our model into various applications.

### Community Growth

- Hosting hackathons, webinars, and workshops to engage the community.
- Releasing regular updates and tutorials.

## Long-Term Goals (3+ Years)

### Democratization of Advanced Machine Intelligence

- Ensuring our model is accessible and usable by people from all walks of life.
- Continuing to grow and nurture our global community of contributors and users.
- Proactively addressing the ethical, societal, and economic implications of advanced machine intelligence.

### Pioneering Research

- Lead and contribute to cutting-edge research in advanced machine intelligence.
- Share our research and learnings openly with the wider community.
- Collaborate with other organizations and researchers to tackle the most challenging problems.
- LONGNET Research Contributions: Contribute to the ongoing research and development of LONGNET and similar models that can handle extremely long sequences, and share our findings with the wider community.

### Reliable and Trustworthy Model

- Continue to improve the explainability and transparency of our model.
- Implement robust mechanisms for oversight and accountability.
- Regularly review and update our practices based on feedback, learnings, and advances in the field.

We hope this roadmap provides clarity on our vision for DREAM. The roadmap is a strategic direction, adaptable and open to changes as we grow and learn. Our journey towards democratizing advanced machine intelligence is a collaborative one, and we welcome all who share our vision to join us on this journey.
